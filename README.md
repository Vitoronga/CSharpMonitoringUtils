# CSharpMonitoringUtils

An easy-to-use C# system monitoring library based on the community project Vanara. The goal of this library is to extract useful functionality from project Vanara and make it more C# friendly (and facilitate its use).

***WARNING: This project is highly experimental and early in progress. Use it at your own risk.***
